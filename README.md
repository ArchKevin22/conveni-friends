Conveni-Friends
===================


A platform to conveniently harness the untapped market of consumers by allowing users to make simple requests, while having other users fulfill them.


Directory layout
-------------
The project is split into two main directories:
####  client
The "client" directory contains the front-end code, written primarily in JavaScript and leveraging Reactive Native.
#### server
The "server" directory is where the back-end code lives, also written in JavaScript and using Express.js.

Test files
-------------
Tests will be contained in their respective directories. For example, server-side tests will be within the server directory.
Instructions on how to run them can be found within the server/ README.
